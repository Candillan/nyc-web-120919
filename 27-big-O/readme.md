# **Algorithms and Big O Notation**

## SWBATs
- [ ] Understand what algorithms are
- [ ] Understand why we use Big O notation to measure algorithmic efficiency
- [ ] Identify common runtimes ( constant, logarithmic, linear, quasi-linear, quadratic )
- [ ] Assess time / space tradeoffs

## What are algorithms?




## How do we measure the efficiency of an algorithm?

Why not just time how long it takes an algorithm to run?





Big picture facts about Big O:

1. A high-level, approximate measure of complexity.
2. Measure of the relationship between the size of the input to the algorithm and the work required to run the algorithm.
    - n is a variable that represents the size of the input
    - O is a function from that variable to an ammount of work
    - What matters: how much more work is required if we increse the input size by 1?
3. Used to measure both time complexity and space complexity.



## Common Big O Increments

1. Constant Time        O(1)

2. Logarithmic Time     O(log(n))

    -

3. Linear Time          O(n)

    -

4. Quasi-linear Time    O(n * log(n))

    -

5. Quadratic            O(n^2)
